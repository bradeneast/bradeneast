# 🪐 I'm Braden, a user-experienced designer.
> I've spent the last five years in web technology and design. Most of that time has been working directly with the humans who use what I create.


## What I'm doing right now
I'm currently in Oklahoma City as part of the creative group for [Oklahoma Baptists](https://oklahomabaptists.org) ⛪. When I get a chance, I code, play drums, go hiking, and ride BMX 🚴.

I also have a [blog for dev-signers](https://bradeneast.com/blog).


## What I'm doing tomorrow
My best code revolves around static sites, CSS animation, and front-end performance 🏆. That's what you can expect to find in my repos.


## Working on a Javascript or CSS project?
I'd love to collaborate and contribute. DM or email me and let's start a conversation.
