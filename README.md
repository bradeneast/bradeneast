# I'm Braden, a user-*experienced* designer 🪐

> I've spent the last five years in web technology and design. Most of that time has been working directly with the humans who use what I create.

## What I'm doing right now
I'm currently in Oklahoma City as part of the creative group for [Oklahoma Baptists](https://oklahomabaptists.org) ⛪. When I get a chance, I code, play drums, and ride BMX.

### Teaching
I have a [blog for dev-signers](https://bradeneast.com/blog), where I share what I've learned at the intersection of design and development.

### Developing
My best projects revolve around static sites, CSS animation, and front-end performance 🏆. That's what you can expect to find in my repos.


## Working on a Javascript or CSS project?
If you thin I'dI'd love to collaborate and contribute. DM or email me and let's start a conversation.
